# Tensorflow lite with ARCore
This is a research project of harnessing the power of ML and ARCore. This allow for detection of object
and HUD will be displayed after it dectected an object.

The application written entirely in Kotlin, Tensorflow Lite and ARCore all libraries are developed by google


# Machine Learning Component
do note the model that I have trained and converted to TFLite is a custom CNN model.

Will be creating another repo for the machine learning component

Do open up issues when you found some thing went wrong!
